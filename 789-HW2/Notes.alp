   1- create point set

   2- create convex hull

   3- get triangles from hull

4- triangulate inside the triangles recursively

5- turn it into a delanuay triangulation

6- return the mesh

   7- create corresponding triangles in the submesh

   8- update vertex coordinates by the quadratic patch
